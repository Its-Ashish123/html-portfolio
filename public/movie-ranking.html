<h1>The best movies of all times by Ashish</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies</h2>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
<p>Starring the young Leonardo di caprio as T. Frank a teenager whose skills as a conman gets him the quick fame. <br>
   Tom hanks perfectly complimented Leo's role as the relentless detective, determined to catch Frank.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>The story continues in the next arc, where Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke along with the Flame Hashira Rengoku are sent to investigate the disappearance of people in the famous mugen train <br>
   The animation is top notch as always and the story alng with the music just makes this easily one of the best anime movies ever.</p>

<h3>Avenger's Endgame</h3>
<p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! <br>
    This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. <br>
    This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. </p>
